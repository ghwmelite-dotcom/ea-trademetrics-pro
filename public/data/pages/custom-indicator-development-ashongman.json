  ],
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Can you create an indicator based on my unique trading idea that I use in Ashongman?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Many of our Ashongman clients have unique market observations and trading methodologies they want visualized as custom indicators. During our consultation, describe your concept in detail, and we'll translate it into a fully functional, professionally coded MT4 or MT5 indicator that brings your idea to life on the charts."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the custom indicator scan multiple currency pairs and timeframes simultaneously?",
      "answer": "Yes, definitely! We specialize in creating scanner-style custom indicators that monitor multiple symbols (forex pairs, indices, commodities, stocks) and timeframes at the same time. Results are displayed in an efficient dashboard panel directly on your chart, alerting you to opportunities across your entire watchlist without manual checking."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will the custom indicator work on both MT4 and MT5 platforms?",
      "answer": "We develop custom indicators for either MT4 (MQL4) or MT5 (MQL5) based on your platform preference. If you want your custom indicator to work on both platforms, we can create parallel versions (one for MT4, one for MT5) for a small additional development fee, giving you maximum flexibility."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you recreate or improve an existing indicator I've seen?",
      "answer": "If you can describe how the indicator works, show us examples of its output, or explain the calculation methodology, we can absolutely create a similar or improved custom version. However, we maintain strict ethical standards and won't copy proprietary code from other developers without permission. We'll build your indicator from scratch with our own professional implementation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How complex can the custom indicator calculations be?",
      "answer": "Very complex! Our MQL programming expertise allows us to implement sophisticated algorithms including neural network predictions, machine learning-based signals, multi-timeframe correlation analysis, advanced statistical methods (regression, standard deviation, z-scores), custom volatility models, and complex multi-indicator combinations. If it can be calculated mathematically, we can code it into your custom indicator."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I get the source code, or just the compiled indicator file?",
      "answer": "You receive both! Every custom indicator we develop comes with the compiled file (.ex4 for MT4 or .ex5 for MT5) ready to use immediately, plus the full source code (.mq4 or .mq5) so you own your indicator completely. You can modify it yourself in the future, share it with your development team, or have us make updates later."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does custom indicator development take for traders in Ashongman?",
      "answer": "Development timeframes range from 1-3 weeks depending on complexity. Simple single-buffer indicators with basic calculations typically complete in 1-2 weeks. Complex multi-buffer indicators with dashboards, scanners, advanced algorithms, or special visual features may take 2-3 weeks. We provide accurate time estimates after reviewing your specific requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I need changes after the indicator is delivered?",
      "answer": "We include 30 days of free minor adjustments and refinements after delivery to ensure your custom indicator performs exactly as you envisioned. We also provide a 60-day bug-fix guarantee if any technical issues arise. For major feature additions or functionality changes beyond the original scope, we offer affordable update services with priority support for existing clients."
