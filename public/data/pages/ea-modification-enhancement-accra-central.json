  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Can you modify an EA if I only have the .ex4 file without source code?",
      "answer": "In most cases, yes. We can decompile .ex4 files and modify the logic, though this process takes longer than working with source code. However, heavily protected or obfuscated EAs may be impossible to modify without the original .mq4 source code. Contact us to assess your specific EA."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does EA modification cost in Accra Central?",
      "answer": "Simple modifications (adding an indicator or time filter) start at $100-200. Medium complexity enhancements (risk management improvements, dashboards) range $200-400. Complex modifications (major functionality overhauls) cost $500-800. We provide fixed-price quotes after analyzing your EA and requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "My EA stopped working after a MetaTrader update. Can you fix it?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! This is one of our most common requests from traders in Accra and globally. MetaTrader platform updates sometimes break older code. We'll modernize your EA to work with current MT4/MT5 builds and ensure compatibility with future updates."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does EA modification take?",
      "answer": "Simple modifications: 1-3 days. Medium complexity: 5-7 days. Complex enhancements: 1-3 weeks. We serve Accra Central's busy trading community with fast turnaround times and provide accurate timeline estimates after initial analysis."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you add new features to an EA developed by another programmer?",
      "answer": "Yes, we regularly enhance EAs created by other developers. Whether purchased from MQL5 marketplace, Fiverr, or coded by another developer, we can add features, fix bugs, and optimize performance as long as we have access to the source code."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you provide support after delivering the modified EA?",
      "answer": "Yes! All EA modification projects include 14 days of free support for adjustments and technical assistance. If issues arise with the modifications, we fix them at no cost. Extended support packages are available for ongoing maintenance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you convert my MT4 EA to work on MT5?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! MT4 to MT5 migration is one of our core specializations. We convert your MT4 EA to MQL5 while maintaining all functionality and can add MT5-specific enhancements like improved backtesting and multi-asset support."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get started with EA modification services in Accra Central?",
      "answer": "Contact us via WhatsApp, email, or phone. Share your EA file (if you have source code, include that), describe what modifications you need, and we'll provide a free consultation, technical analysis, and fixed-price quote within 24 hours."
