  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Can you modify EAs without source code (.mq4 file)?",
      "answer": "Yes, in most cases we can decompile .ex4 files and implement modifications. The process takes longer than working with source code, and heavily obfuscated or protected EAs may present challenges. We'll assess your specific EA and advise on feasibility during the free consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What types of EA modifications do you handle in Osu?",
      "answer": "We handle all EA modifications: adding indicators, implementing trailing stops, creating dashboards, adding news filters, improving risk management, optimizing slow code, fixing bugs, updating for new MT4/MT5 versions, converting MT4 to MT5, and comprehensive feature additions."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can you complete EA modifications?",
      "answer": "Simple modifications: 1-3 days. Medium complexity: 5-7 days. Complex enhancements: 1-3 weeks. We prioritize fast turnaround for Osu's active trading community while maintaining quality standards. Rush service available for urgent needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will modifications break my EA's existing functionality?",
      "answer": "No. We maintain backward compatibility and preserve all existing profitable logic. Modifications are tested thoroughly to ensure they enhance rather than disrupt your EA's performance. You can always revert to the original if needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you work with EAs from other developers?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We regularly enhance EAs purchased from MQL5 marketplace, developed by freelancers, or coded by other companies. As long as we can access the code (source or decompiled), we can modify and improve it."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's included in the 14-day support period?",
      "answer": "Post-delivery support includes bug fixes related to modifications, minor adjustments to settings or behavior, technical assistance with installation, and clarification on how new features work. Major feature additions beyond original scope are quoted separately."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you optimize my EA for better performance?",
      "answer": "Yes! We specialize in code optimization: reducing CPU usage, improving execution speed, eliminating memory leaks, optimizing indicator calculations, and implementing efficient data structures. Many Osu traders see 30-50% performance improvements."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I start the EA modification process?",
      "answer": "Contact us via phone, WhatsApp, or email. Share your EA file (include source code if available), describe desired modifications, and we'll provide free technical analysis and fixed-price quote within 24 hours. Located in Osu for convenient consultations."
