  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Why is forward testing necessary if I've already backtested my EA?",
      "answer": "Backtesting uses historical data without real spreads, slippage, or execution delays. Forward testing reveals how your EA actually performs with these real-world factors in live market conditions. For Accra Central traders, this is crucial before deploying capital in Ghana's competitive forex market."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long should forward testing run for reliable results?",
      "answer": "We recommend minimum 30 days to capture various market conditions, ideally 60-90 days to include different volatility regimes and see consistency. Longer testing periods provide more reliable data for Accra Central businesses making trading decisions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you test on specific brokers available in Ghana?",
      "answer": "Yes! We can set up demo accounts with any broker you specify, including those popular in Ghana and Accra Central. We also offer multi-broker testing to compare execution quality and performance across different platforms."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my EA performs poorly during forward testing?",
      "answer": "This is valuable information that saves you from potential losses! Poor forward testing results mean the EA needs optimization or isn't ready for live trading. It's better to discover this on demo accounts than with real money in Accra Central's financial markets."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you provide public tracking links for transparency?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We can set up public tracking on MyFxBook, FX Blue, or similar platforms so you can monitor your EA's forward testing progress in real-time from anywhere in Accra Central or globally."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's included in the final validation report?",
      "answer": "You receive a comprehensive PDF report with all performance statistics, complete trade logs, profit/loss analysis, drawdown metrics, win rate, broker execution comparison, and our expert recommendation on whether the EA is ready for live trading in Accra Central markets."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I make changes to my EA during forward testing?",
      "answer": "We recommend completing the full testing period without changes to get accurate results. However, if you need to update your EA, we can start a new testing period to validate the modified version for Accra Central deployment."
