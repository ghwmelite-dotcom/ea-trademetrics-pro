  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Will my MT4 EA work exactly the same on MT5 after migration?",
      "answer": "Yes! We guarantee 98%+ signal accuracy through rigorous testing and comparison. Your EA will produce the same trading signals and logic, but you'll benefit from MT5's improved execution speed and better order filling capabilities available through brokers serving Accra Central."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the main advantages of MT5 over MT4 for trading in Ghana?",
      "answer": "MT5 offers several key advantages: faster execution with better fills, more accurate backtesting using real tick data, support for trading stocks and commodities alongside forex, improved order management, economic calendar integration for fundamental analysis, and it's the future-focused platform with ongoing development from MetaQuotes."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does MT4 to MT5 migration take for Accra Central clients?",
      "answer": "Most EA migrations are completed within 2-4 weeks depending on complexity. Simple single-strategy EAs may be ready in 1-2 weeks, while complex multi-indicator systems with custom functions may take 4-6 weeks. We provide realistic timelines after analyzing your specific EA."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I continue using my MT4 EA while the MT5 version is being developed?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! The migration process doesn't affect your existing MT4 EA. You can continue trading with your current MT4 system until the MT5 version is ready, tested, and you're comfortable making the switch."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I get the full source code for the MT5 version?",
      "answer": "Yes, you receive complete ownership of both the compiled EA file (.ex5) and the full MQL5 source code (.mq5). This allows you to make future modifications, understand the code structure, and maintain full control over your trading automation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will the MT5 EA work with both hedging and netting account types?",
      "answer": "We configure your EA to work with your preferred account type. MT5 supports both hedging mode (like MT4, allowing multiple positions on same pair) and netting mode (single position per symbol). We discuss your requirements during consultation and implement accordingly."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I want additional MT5-specific features beyond basic conversion?",
      "answer": "We can enhance your EA with MT5-exclusive features like economic calendar integration for news trading, multi-threading for faster calculations, depth of market analysis, or improved risk management using MT5's advanced position management. These enhancements are quoted separately based on complexity."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you provide support after the migration is complete?",
      "answer": "Yes! All MT4 to MT5 migrations include 30 days of free support for bug fixes and adjustments. We're based in Accra Central for convenient local communication and can provide ongoing maintenance plans for long-term support if needed."
