  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Will my migrated MT5 EA work with international brokers worldwide?",
      "answer": "Yes! We test migrated EAs across multiple international MT5 broker demo accounts to ensure compatibility. MT5 is more standardized globally than MT4, so your migrated EA will work consistently across brokers in Europe, Asia, Americas, and Africa, though minor broker-specific optimizations may be recommended."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you optimize the EA for specific international brokers I use?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. During migration, we can optimize for your specific brokers' execution models, server locations, and platform configurations. This is especially valuable for traders using multiple international brokers or those trading across different time zones from Airport Residential Area."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does MT5 handle different time zones for international trading?",
      "answer": "MT5 has improved time management compared to MT4, making it better for international traders dealing with multiple time zones. We can configure your migrated EA to handle broker server time, local time, and specific session times for different global markets you trade."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I need support outside Ghana business hours?",
      "answer": "We offer 24/7 support scheduling for Airport Residential clients trading international markets. While our office hours are GMT business hours, we provide email and messaging support around the clock, with urgent issues addressed via our international support team within 2-4 hours."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the MT5 EA trade during overnight sessions while I'm traveling?",
      "answer": "Yes, this is ideal for business travelers and international professionals in Airport Residential. MT5 EAs run 24/7 on VPS servers, trading automatically across all global sessions. We can help you select and configure VPS hosting in optimal server locations for your brokers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you support EAs that trade news events across global markets?",
      "answer": "Yes! MT5's economic calendar integration is perfect for news trading strategies. During migration, we can enhance your EA to utilize MT5's built-in economic calendar, filter trades around major news releases, or implement news-based trading logic for multiple international markets."
    },
    {
      "question": "What languages do you provide support in?",
      "answer": "Primary support is in English, which serves our international clientele well. We can also coordinate with translators for technical documentation in other languages if needed for your team or trading partners."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you migrate multiple EAs for a diversified international portfolio?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Many Airport Residential traders run multiple EAs across different strategies and asset classes. We offer volume discounts for multi-EA migration projects and can help coordinate a comprehensive portfolio migration strategy to MT5."
