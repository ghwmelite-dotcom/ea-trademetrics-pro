  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What makes your MT4 to MT5 migration service suitable for high-net-worth traders in Cantonments?",
      "answer": "We provide premium, white-glove service including dedicated project managers, priority communication, flexible meeting locations in Cantonments, absolute confidentiality agreements, and superior technical execution. Our migrations achieve 98%+ accuracy while optimizing performance for sophisticated strategies like scalping and high-frequency trading that Cantonments' elite traders often employ."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much faster is MT5 execution compared to MT4?",
      "answer": "MT5 typically executes trades 30-50% faster than MT4 due to more efficient architecture and better broker connectivity. For scalpers and high-frequency traders in Cantonments, this speed advantage translates directly to better fills, reduced slippage, and improved profitability—especially during high-volatility periods."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you expedite the migration process for urgent requirements?",
      "answer": "Yes, we offer expedited service for Cantonments clients who need faster delivery. Priority migrations can be completed in 1-2 weeks depending on EA complexity. Expedited service includes dedicated development resources and costs approximately 30% premium over standard pricing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you offer ongoing maintenance and optimization after migration?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. We provide premium maintenance packages for Cantonments clients including monthly performance reviews, optimization updates, broker-specific adjustments, and priority support. These ensure your MT5 EA continues performing optimally as market conditions and broker platforms evolve."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you ensure confidentiality for sensitive trading strategies?",
      "answer": "We sign comprehensive non-disclosure agreements before reviewing any code. Your EA source code, trading logic, and all communications are strictly confidential. We maintain enterprise-grade security protocols and can work within your preferred secure communication channels."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the migrated MT5 EA trade multiple asset classes simultaneously?",
      "answer": "Yes, this is one of MT5's key advantages. Your migrated EA can trade forex, stocks, indices, commodities, and futures from a single platform. We can configure multi-asset support during migration or add it as an enhancement for portfolio-style trading strategies popular among Cantonments' sophisticated investors."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my MT4 EA uses custom indicators or proprietary libraries?",
      "answer": "We handle custom indicators and proprietary code expertly. All custom components are migrated to MT5 equivalents, maintaining functionality while leveraging MT5's improved performance. If you use third-party protected indicators, we can recreate equivalent functionality in MQL5."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you provide performance comparison reports?",
      "answer": "Yes, every migration includes a comprehensive comparison report showing side-by-side performance of MT4 and MT5 versions on identical historical data. The report includes signal accuracy percentage, execution speed improvements, backtesting metrics, and detailed analysis—perfect for institutional traders requiring documentation."
