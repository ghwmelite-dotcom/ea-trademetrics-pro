  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How long does MT4 to MT5 migration take?",
      "answer": "Most EA migrations are completed within 2-4 weeks. Simple single-strategy EAs may be ready in 1-2 weeks, while complex multi-indicator systems may take 4-6 weeks. We provide realistic timelines after analyzing your specific EA during the free consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will my EA work exactly the same on MT5?",
      "answer": "Yes! We guarantee 98%+ signal accuracy through comprehensive testing. Your migrated MT5 EA will execute the same trading logic and produce identical signals as your MT4 version, while benefiting from MT5's superior execution speed and features."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is your Dzorwulu office easy to reach?",
      "answer": "Yes, our Dzorwulu location near Accra Mall is very accessible with excellent transportation links. We're easy to reach from all parts of Accra. We can also meet at your location or conduct consultations online if that's more convenient for you."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to understand programming to use the migrated EA?",
      "answer": "Not at all! We provide clear documentation and training on using your migrated MT5 EA. Whether you're technical or prefer to focus purely on trading, we explain everything in plain language and ensure you're comfortable operating your EA."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you migrate EAs that use custom indicators?",
      "answer": "Yes, we handle custom indicators expertly. All custom components are migrated to MT5 equivalents while maintaining functionality. If you use third-party protected indicators, we can recreate equivalent functionality in MQL5 or work with you to source MT5 versions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What payment options do you accept?",
      "answer": "We accept mobile money, bank transfers, and can arrange other convenient payment methods for Dzorwulu and central Accra clients. Payment terms are flexible with milestone-based options for larger projects."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you provide support after delivery?",
      "answer": "Yes, all migrations include 30 days of comprehensive support for bug fixes and adjustments. Support is provided via phone, WhatsApp, email, or in-person meetings at our Dzorwulu office as convenient for you."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I see examples of your previous work?",
      "answer": "While we maintain client confidentiality, we can provide general examples of migration quality, demonstrate our development environment, and provide references from satisfied Dzorwulu-area clients upon request during consultation."
