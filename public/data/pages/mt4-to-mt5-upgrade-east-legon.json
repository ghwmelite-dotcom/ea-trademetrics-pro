  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Can you integrate my MT5 EA with modern trading infrastructure and APIs?",
      "answer": "Yes! Beyond basic migration, we can integrate your MT5 EA with modern trading infrastructure including REST APIs for signal distribution, webhook notifications, cloud database logging, telegram/discord alerts, and integration with portfolio management systems. MT5's superior architecture makes these integrations more reliable than MT4."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you use version control and modern development practices?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. All EA migrations are managed using Git version control, allowing you to track changes, collaborate with team members, and maintain code history. We follow modern development practices including code review, testing, documentation, and can provide access to your project repository."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the migrated EA be optimized using machine learning or AI techniques?",
      "answer": "Yes! MT5's enhanced capabilities make it excellent for algorithmic and AI-enhanced trading. During migration, we can add hooks for external Python/R models, implement adaptive parameter optimization, or integrate machine learning-based signal filtering. These advanced features are quoted based on complexity."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does MT5 perform for high-frequency and algorithmic trading compared to MT4?",
      "answer": "MT5 significantly outperforms MT4 for algorithmic trading with 30-50% faster execution, better order management, more accurate tick data, and support for multi-threading. For East Legon's algorithmic traders, these improvements translate to better fills, reduced slippage, and more reliable automated strategy execution."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you provide performance analytics and benchmarking after migration?",
      "answer": "Yes, we provide comprehensive performance analytics comparing MT4 and MT5 versions including execution speed benchmarks, slippage analysis, signal accuracy metrics, and backtesting comparisons with data visualization. You'll have clear metrics showing the migration's performance improvements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you support containerized deployment for cloud trading infrastructure?",
      "answer": "Yes! We can configure your migrated MT5 EA for modern cloud deployment including Docker containers, Kubernetes orchestration, and cloud VPS setups optimized for MT5. This is ideal for East Legon traders building scalable, modern trading infrastructure."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the EA be configured for portfolio-level risk management across multiple strategies?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. MT5's superior architecture enables sophisticated portfolio management. We can implement global risk limits, correlation-based position sizing, portfolio-level drawdown protection, and multi-strategy coordination—features particularly valuable for quantitative traders in East Legon."
    },
    {
      "question": "What modern monitoring and alerting capabilities can be added?",
      "answer": "We can implement comprehensive monitoring including real-time performance dashboards, custom alert systems (email, SMS, Telegram, Discord), error logging to cloud services, trade notifications with analytics, and integration with monitoring platforms. MT5's architecture makes these implementations more robust than MT4."
