  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What makes your service different from other MT4 to MT5 migration providers?",
      "answer": "Our boutique approach means personalized attention to each client. You work directly with experienced developers, not account managers. We limit the number of simultaneous projects to ensure quality, provide regular progress updates, and build long-term relationships. Each migration is treated as a unique project, not a template-based conversion."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I be involved in the migration process and provide feedback?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We encourage client involvement. You'll receive regular progress updates, can review intermediate versions, provide feedback throughout development, and participate in testing. This collaborative approach ensures the final result perfectly matches your vision and requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you work with individual traders or only firms?",
      "answer": "We specialize in serving individual traders who appreciate personalized service. While we work with some small firms, our strength is providing boutique, relationship-based service to individual professional traders in Labone and surrounding areas who value quality over mass-market solutions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I need modifications after the migration is complete?",
      "answer": "We build long-term relationships with clients. The 60 days of support includes reasonable modifications and adjustments. After that, you can contract ongoing support or request modifications as needed. Many Labone clients maintain ongoing relationships for continuous EA improvement."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you ensure the migrated EA matches my trading style?",
      "answer": "Through thorough consultation, we understand your trading philosophy, risk tolerance, and objectives. The migration preserves your strategy's core logic while optimizing for MT5. We can also suggest enhancements that align with your style, always prioritizing your preferences and vision."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you help optimize the EA beyond basic migration?",
      "answer": "Yes! Many Labone clients appreciate optimization opportunities. We can enhance risk management, improve signal filtering, add new indicators, or implement advanced features during migration. We discuss these opportunities during consultation and implement what makes sense for your strategy."
    },
    {
      "question": "What level of technical knowledge do I need?",
      "answer": "None! Part of our boutique service is explaining technical aspects in plain language. Whether you're technically sophisticated or prefer to focus on trading while we handle the technology, we adapt our communication style to your preferences."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you provide training on MT5's new features?",
      "answer": "Yes, personalized training is included. During delivery, we walk through MT5-specific features relevant to your EA, demonstrate new capabilities, and ensure you're comfortable with the migrated system. We can also provide additional training sessions if needed."
