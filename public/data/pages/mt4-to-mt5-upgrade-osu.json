  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How accurate is the MT4 to MT5 migration for my EA?",
      "answer": "We guarantee 98%+ signal accuracy through comprehensive testing. Your migrated MT5 EA will execute the same trading logic and produce identical signals as the original MT4 version, while benefiting from MT5's superior execution speed and order management available through brokers in Osu and across Ghana."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes MT5 better than MT4 for traders in Osu?",
      "answer": "MT5 offers significant advantages: faster trade execution with better fills, more precise backtesting using real tick data instead of interpolated ticks, support for trading multiple asset classes beyond forex, improved position management, economic calendar integration for fundamental analysis, and it represents the future of the MetaTrader platform with ongoing support and development."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you migrate my EA if I only have the compiled .ex4 file?",
      "answer": "While we prefer working with source code (.mq4) for best results, we can decompile and migrate .ex4 files in most cases. However, heavily protected EAs may have limitations. Contact our Osu office for a free assessment of your specific EA file."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does the migration process take?",
      "answer": "Most MT4 to MT5 EA migrations are completed within 2-4 weeks. Simple single-indicator EAs may be ready in 1-2 weeks, while complex multi-strategy systems with numerous custom functions may take 4-6 weeks. We provide a realistic timeline after analyzing your EA during the free consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I receive the full MQL5 source code?",
      "answer": "Yes! You receive complete ownership of both the compiled .ex5 file and the full MQL5 source code (.mq5). This ensures you can make future modifications, understand the implementation, and maintain full control over your trading automation system."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the migrated EA work with hedging and netting accounts?",
      "answer": "We configure your EA for your preferred account type during migration. MT5 supports both hedging mode (like MT4, allowing multiple positions on the same pair) and netting mode (single position per symbol). We discuss your requirements and trading style to implement the optimal configuration."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you add MT5-specific features during migration?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Beyond basic conversion, we can enhance your EA with MT5-exclusive features like economic calendar integration, multi-threading for parallel processing, depth of market analysis, or advanced position management. These enhancements are quoted separately based on complexity and development time required."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you provide support after delivery in Osu?",
      "answer": "Yes, all migrations include 30 days of free support for bug fixes and minor adjustments. Being based in Osu provides convenient local communication. We also offer ongoing maintenance plans for long-term support, updates, and optimization services."
