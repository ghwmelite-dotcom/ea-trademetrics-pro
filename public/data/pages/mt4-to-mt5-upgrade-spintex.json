  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much does MT4 to MT5 migration cost?",
      "answer": "Transparent pricing starts at $250 for straightforward EAs. Complex multi-strategy systems with advanced features range $500-$1000. We provide a free EA analysis and honest quote with no hidden costs. Payment plans available for Spintex business clients."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will the migrated EA really perform better on MT5?",
      "answer": "Yes! MT5 typically executes trades 30-50% faster than MT4, provides more accurate backtesting with real ticks, and offers better order management. These improvements translate to better fills, reduced slippage, and more reliable automated trading performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is your service accessible from both Accra and Tema?",
      "answer": "Yes, our Spintex corridor location is convenient from both Accra and Tema. We're easy to reach via the Spintex road and can also meet at your location or conduct consultations online if that works better for you."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I'm not satisfied with the migration?",
      "answer": "We stand behind our work with a money-back satisfaction guarantee. If the migrated EA doesn't meet the agreed specifications or doesn't achieve 98%+ signal accuracy, we'll make it right or refund your payment. Your satisfaction is our priority."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need technical knowledge to use the migrated EA?",
      "answer": "No technical knowledge needed! We provide clear, practical documentation and training on operating your MT5 EA. Whether you're technically inclined or prefer to focus purely on trading, we explain everything in straightforward language."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can you complete the migration?",
      "answer": "Most migrations are completed within 2-4 weeks. Simple EAs may be ready in 1-2 weeks, complex systems may take 4-6 weeks. We provide realistic timelines upfront and keep you updated on progress throughout the project."
    },
    {
      "question": "What support do you provide after delivery?",
      "answer": "All migrations include 30 days of comprehensive support for bug fixes, adjustments, and questions. Support is accessible via phone, WhatsApp, or in-person meetings at our Spintex location. We're here to ensure your EA works perfectly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you migrate EAs from other developers?",
      "answer": "Yes! We migrate EAs from any source as long as we have access to the source code (.mq4 file). If you only have the compiled .ex4 file, we can often still migrate it, though this may take additional time. Contact us for assessment."
