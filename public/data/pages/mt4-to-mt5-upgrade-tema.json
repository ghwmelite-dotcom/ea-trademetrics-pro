    {
      "question": "Can your MT5 EA handle commodity trading and business hedging?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! MT5 is excellent for commodity trading with native support for futures, options, and commodities alongside forex. We can migrate your hedging strategies to MT5 and enhance them with MT5's superior multi-asset capabilities, making it ideal for Tema's business traders managing commodity price risks."
    },
    {
      "question": "How reliable is the migrated EA for business-critical trading?",
      "answer": "We design for industrial-grade reliability with comprehensive error handling, recovery systems, and extensive testing including stress testing. Many Tema business clients use our migrated EAs for critical hedging operations. The 98%+ signal accuracy and robust code ensure dependable performance for business operations."
    },

    },
    {
      "question": "What if my business requires urgent EA migration?",

      "answer": "The 30 days support includes prompt issue resolution. For business-critical EAs, we also offer priority support packages with faster response times and direct developer contact. We understand business trading can't afford extended downtime."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the EA generate reports for business accounting purposes?",
