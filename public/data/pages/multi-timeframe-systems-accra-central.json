  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What timeframe combinations work best for MTF systems?",
      "answer": "Popular combinations for Accra Central traders include D1/H4/H1 for swing trading, H4/H1/M15 for day trading, and H1/M15/M5 for scalping. The key is maintaining a 3-4x ratio between timeframes for proper top-down analysis. We help you choose the optimal combination based on your trading style and available trading hours."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do multi-timeframe EAs trade less frequently?",
      "answer": "Yes, typically MTF systems generate 30-50% fewer trades than single-timeframe EAs because they require alignment across multiple timeframes. However, the trades they do take have significantly higher win rates and better risk-reward ratios due to superior filtering and confirmation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I combine different indicators across timeframes?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! This is very effective. For example: moving average crossover on D1 for overall trend direction, RSI divergence on H1 for setup confirmation, and price action patterns on M15 for precise entry timing. We specialize in creating these sophisticated cross-timeframe indicator combinations."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you prevent look-ahead bias in MTF analysis?",
      "answer": "We use proper MQL functions like iCustom() and CopyBuffer() with correct shift parameters to ensure multi-timeframe data is synchronized and represents only what would have been known at each historical bar. This prevents artificial performance inflation from future data leaking into past decisions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are MTF systems better than single-timeframe EAs?",
      "answer": "For most trading strategies, yes. MTF systems align with how professional traders think - analyzing higher timeframes for direction before lower timeframes for entry. This produces higher quality, more consistent results. However, very high-frequency scalping strategies may not benefit from MTF analysis."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can MTF systems work with my existing trading strategy?",
      "answer": "Most likely yes! If you currently trade using top-down analysis or check multiple timeframes before entering trades, we can automate that exact process. We work with traders in Accra Central to codify their manual MTF approach into automated Expert Advisors."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the minimum and maximum number of timeframes to analyze?",
      "answer": "Minimum is 2 timeframes for basic MTF confirmation. Maximum is typically 4 timeframes, as more than that adds complexity without significant performance improvement. Most effective MTF systems use 3 timeframes for trend-confirmation-entry hierarchy."
