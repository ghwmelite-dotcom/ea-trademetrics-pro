  "faq": [
    {"question": "How do MTF systems improve trading?", "answer": "MTF systems require confirmation across multiple timeframes, dramatically reducing false signals. This top-down approach produces fewer but higher-quality trades with improved win rates and better risk-reward ratios."},
    {"question": "What timeframe combinations work best?", "answer": "D1/H4/H1 for swing trading, H4/H1/M15 for day trading, H1/M30/M15 for scalping. We configure your MTF system based on your trading style, schedule, and preferred markets."},
    {"question": "Can MTF EAs work for busy Adenta professionals?", "answer": "Absolutely! MTF EAs run 24/5 on VPS servers, analyzing timeframes continuously and executing only when conditions align. Perfect for busy professionals who can't watch charts constantly."},
    {"question": "What capital is needed?", "answer": "$500-$1000 minimum for forex with proper risk management. Key is percentage-based sizing that grows with your account. Start conservatively, prove system, scale up."},
    {"question": "How accurate are MTF backtests?", "answer": "We ensure 98%+ accuracy through proper MQL programming eliminating look-ahead bias. Backtests represent only information available at each historical moment, producing realistic expectations."},
    {"question": "What maintenance is needed?", "answer": "Minimal. Weekly performance checks (15-30 min) and quarterly optimization recommended. MTF systems are more robust than single-timeframe EAs, requiring less frequent adjustment."},
    {"question": "What support do Adenta clients receive?", "answer": "30 days comprehensive support: installation, optimization, performance review, troubleshooting. Many continue with maintenance plans ($99-199/month) for ongoing optimization and updates."}
