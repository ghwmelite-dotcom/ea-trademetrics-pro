    {
      "question": "What makes your MTF systems institutional-grade?",
      "answer": "Our institutional-grade MTF systems feature rigorous cross-timeframe validation, professional object-oriented code architecture, comprehensive error handling, advanced position management, real-time monitoring dashboards, and exhaustive backtesting. We follow the same development standards used by trading firms and hedge funds, not retail EA shops."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can MTF systems work for international markets from Cantonments?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Our MTF EAs are designed for global markets - forex majors, US/European indices, commodities, and cryptocurrencies. We optimize timeframe combinations for your preferred trading sessions, whether London open, US hours, or Asian session, ensuring the system matches your Cantonments-based schedule."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does multi-timeframe analysis improve consistency?",
      "answer": "MTF analysis dramatically improves consistency by filtering out noise and low-probability setups. Single-timeframe systems react to every fluctuation; MTF systems only trade when multiple timeframes confirm genuine opportunity. This produces fewer but significantly higher-quality trades with more predictable results."
    },
    {
      "question": "What level of customization is available?",
      "answer": "Extensive customization for our Cantonments clients: specific timeframe combinations, custom indicators per timeframe, unique confirmation logic, position sizing algorithms, risk management rules, trading session filters, dashboard display preferences, and alert configurations. Your MTF EA reflects your exact methodology."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you ensure the MTF logic is realistic?",
      "answer": "We eliminate look-ahead bias through proper MQL shift calculations and data synchronization. Every backtest reflects only information available at that historical moment across all timeframes. This produces realistic performance expectations, not artificially inflated results from future data contamination."
    },
    {
      "question": "What ongoing support do Cantonments clients receive?",
      "answer": "Premium 60-day support with priority response (24-hour maximum), dedicated support channel, monthly performance review calls, free parameter optimization updates, market condition analysis, and trading guidance. Unlike standard EA sellers, we partner with you for long-term success."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the MTF system adapt to changing market conditions?",
      "answer": "Yes! Advanced MTF systems include adaptive logic that adjusts confirmation thresholds based on volatility, trend strength, and market regime. This adaptation maintains performance across varying conditions without manual intervention, providing robust automation for busy Cantonments professionals."
