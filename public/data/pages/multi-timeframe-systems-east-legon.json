  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How does MTF analysis benefit busy East Legon entrepreneurs?",
      "answer": "MTF systems provide high-quality, hands-free trading automation perfect for busy entrepreneurs. By requiring confirmation across multiple timeframes, MTF EAs filter out impulsive trades and market noise, executing only when genuine opportunities emerge. This means fewer but significantly better trades - ideal when you're focused on running your business and can't watch charts constantly."
    },
    {
      "question": "What timeframe combinations work best for part-time traders?",
      "answer": "For East Legon professionals trading part-time: D1/H4/H1 for swing trading (check once daily), H4/H1/M30 for evening trading after work, or H1/M30/M15 for dedicated weekend trading sessions. We configure your MTF system to match your available time while maintaining superior filtering and trade quality."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can MTF systems trade while I'm running my business?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! That's exactly their purpose. MTF EAs run fully automated on VPS servers, analyzing multiple timeframes 24/5 and executing only when all conditions align. You focus on your East Legon business ventures while the MTF system manages trading based on your predefined strategy and risk parameters."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much capital do I need for MTF EA trading?",
      "answer": "MTF systems work with various capital levels. Minimum recommended: $500-$1000 for forex, $2000-$5000 for indices. The key isn't capital size but proper risk management - we configure your MTF EA to risk only 0.5-2% per trade based on your account size, ensuring sustainable growth regardless of starting capital."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes your MTF development different from others?",
      "answer": "We emphasize realistic performance through proper programming practices that eliminate look-ahead bias, comprehensive testing across diverse market conditions, transparent communication throughout development, and genuine partnership rather than transactional service. East Legon clients appreciate our professionalism and commitment to delivering systems that actually work as advertised."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you integrate MTF filtering into my existing EA?",
      "answer": "Yes! We frequently upgrade existing single-timeframe EAs with multi-timeframe filtering. This transformation often converts mediocre systems into profitable ones by adding intelligent cross-timeframe confirmation that dramatically improves win rate and reduces drawdowns. Typically takes 2-3 weeks depending on existing EA complexity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What ongoing optimization is needed for MTF systems?",
      "answer": "MTF systems are more robust than single-timeframe EAs and require less frequent optimization. Recommended: quarterly review of parameters, semi-annual comprehensive optimization, and adjustment if you change traded markets or timeframes. We offer optimization services for East Legon clients wanting ongoing performance enhancement and market adaptation."
