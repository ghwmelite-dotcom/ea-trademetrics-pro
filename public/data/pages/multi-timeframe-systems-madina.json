  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Can university students afford MTF EA development?",
      "answer": "We offer flexible payment plans for Madina's university community. Basic 2-timeframe systems start at $500, with options to start simple and upgrade later. Many students partner with friends to share development costs, or start with existing strategy optimization before full custom development. Education-focused pricing available for verified students."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does MTF analysis compare to academic trading models?",
      "answer": "MTF analysis aligns perfectly with academic trading theory - multiple timeframe confirmation provides statistical validation similar to academic peer review. Rather than acting on single data point (one timeframe), MTF requires agreement across multiple timeframes, dramatically improving statistical significance of trade signals."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can MTF systems work with limited trading capital?",
      "answer": "Yes! Minimum $500 for forex MTF trading with proper micro-lot risk management. The beauty of MTF systems is improved win rate, which works even better with small accounts - fewer but higher-quality trades means capital preservation and steady growth. We configure risk management appropriately for your account size."
    },
    {
      "question": "What programming knowledge is needed to use an MTF EA?",
      "answer": "None! Using an MTF EA requires no programming knowledge - just understanding how to install on MT4/MT5 and adjust basic settings (we provide detailed guides). However, having source code allows future modifications as you learn. Many Madina traders use EAs as practical learning tools for algorithmic trading concepts."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long until MTF systems become profitable?",
      "answer": "MTF systems can show positive results immediately if strategy is sound, but we recommend 3-6 months evaluation period for statistical significance. Academic approach: judge performance over dozens of trades, not days. Proper expectation: consistent monthly performance after initial optimization period, not instant wealth."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can MTF EAs help learn trading while automating?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! MTF EAs are excellent educational tools. By observing which trades the MTF system takes versus rejects, you learn practical multi-timeframe analysis. We include detailed logs showing why each timeframe condition triggered or failed - turning your EA into an interactive learning platform."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes your MTF development academic-grade?",
      "answer": "We emphasize rigorous methodology: proper statistical testing, documented assumptions, realistic performance expectations, transparent backtest results, peer-reviewed programming practices, and comprehensive documentation. Unlike many EA developers promising unrealistic returns, we focus on sound methodology producing sustainable results."
