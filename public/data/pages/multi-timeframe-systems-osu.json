  "description": "Elevate your trading automation with sophisticated multi-timeframe Expert Advisor development serving Osu's dynamic business community. Specializing in professional MTF systems for traders along Oxford Street and throughout Osu's vibrant commercial district, we build EAs that analyze 2-4 timeframes simultaneously to filter out low-probability setups and focus on high-quality trades. Our multi-timeframe approach implements the same top-down methodology used by institutional traders - checking higher timeframe trends, confirming medium timeframe setups, and executing on lower timeframe precision entries. Whether you're managing trading accounts from your Osu office or trading remotely, our MTF systems deliver dramatic performance improvements through intelligent cross-timeframe filtering. Osu-based traders appreciate our expertise in hierarchical decision logic, MTF indicator synchronization, and configurable timeframe combinations optimized for African and international market sessions. We specialize in MTF systems for swing traders (D1/H4/H1 combinations), day traders (H4/H1/M15 setups), and scalpers (H1/M15/M5 configurations), ensuring the system matches your trading style and schedule. Each multi-timeframe EA includes visual MTF dashboard displays showing alignment across all analyzed timeframes, sophisticated position management that responds to changing timeframe conditions, and comprehensive backtesting validation across multiple years of market data. Our development process ensures zero look-ahead bias through proper MQL data handling, producing realistic performance expectations you can trust. Serving Osu's entrepreneurial trading community with cutting-edge algorithmic solutions that combine academic rigor with practical market experience for consistent, robust trading automation you can rely on.",

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What makes multi-timeframe systems better than single timeframe EAs?",
      "answer": "MTF systems provide superior trade filtering by requiring confirmation across multiple time horizons. While single-timeframe EAs might take every signal on M15, an MTF system only trades when M15 signals align with H1 setup and H4 trend - dramatically improving win rate and reducing false signals from market noise."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many timeframes should my EA analyze?",
      "answer": "We recommend 3 timeframes for optimal balance: higher for trend, medium for setup, lower for entry. For example, D1 (trend) → H4 (setup) → H1 (entry) for swing trading, or H4 (trend) → H1 (setup) → M15 (entry) for day trading. More than 4 timeframes adds complexity without proportional benefit."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you integrate MTF analysis into my existing EA?",
      "answer": "Yes! We can add multi-timeframe filtering to your current EA. This upgrade often transforms mediocre single-timeframe systems into profitable MTF systems by adding intelligent trade filtering that dramatically improves win rate and consistency."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do MTF systems work better in trending or ranging markets?",
      "answer": "MTF systems excel in all conditions. In trending markets, they ride trends longer by confirming continuation across timeframes. In ranging markets, they avoid false breakouts by requiring multiple timeframe confirmation. This adaptability makes MTF systems more robust than single-timeframe alternatives."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does MTF EA development take in Osu?",
      "answer": "Typical development takes 3-6 weeks depending on complexity. Simple 2-timeframe systems (3-4 weeks), standard 3-timeframe systems with multiple indicators (4-5 weeks), advanced 4-timeframe systems with custom logic (5-6 weeks). We provide progress updates throughout development."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can MTF systems trade during African market sessions?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We configure your MTF EA to optimize for the market sessions you trade. Whether you're trading London open from Osu, US session evening hours, or Asian session overnight, the timeframe combinations and logic adapt to your specific trading schedule and preferred markets."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's included in the MTF EA delivery package?",
      "answer": "Complete package includes: compiled EA file, full source code (.mq4/.mq5), detailed MTF configuration guide, visual examples of timeframe alignment, backtesting reports across multiple years, optimization recommendations, installation instructions, and 30 days support from our Osu-based team."
