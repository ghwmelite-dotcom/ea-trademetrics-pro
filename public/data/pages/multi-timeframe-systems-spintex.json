  "faq": [
    {"question": "How does MTF analysis benefit Spintex commercial traders?", "answer": "MTF systems provide hands-free automation perfect for busy commercial professionals. Cross-timeframe confirmation filters out noise, executing only high-probability setups - ideal when you're focused on business and can't watch charts constantly."},
    {"question": "What timeframe combinations work for Spintex traders?", "answer": "D1/H4/H1 for swing trading (check once daily), H4/H1/M30 for evening trading after work, H1/M30/M15 for dedicated sessions. We configure MTF systems matching your commercial schedule."},
    {"question": "Can MTF EAs trade while I'm at work?", "answer": "Absolutely! MTF EAs run 24/5 on VPS servers, analyzing timeframes continuously and executing only when conditions align. You focus on Spintex business while MTF system trades based on your strategy."},
