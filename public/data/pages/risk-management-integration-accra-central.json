  ],

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between basic and advanced risk management for EAs in Accra Central?",
      "answer": "Basic risk management in most EAs is just fixed lot size and stop loss. Our advanced systems include dynamic position sizing that adjusts based on account equity, portfolio-level loss limits (daily/weekly/monthly), correlation controls to prevent overexposure, volatility-adjusted sizing, trailing drawdown protection, and emergency shutdown functionality. This is the difference between retail and institutional-grade risk management."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you integrate risk management into my existing EA?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We can integrate our advanced risk management framework into any EA, whether built by us or another developer. We just need access to the source code (.mq4/.mq5 file). The integration preserves all your original trading logic while adding sophisticated risk controls."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does dynamic position sizing help me grow my trading account in Accra?",
      "answer": "Dynamic position sizing automatically increases your lot size as your account grows and decreases it during drawdown periods. For example, if you start with $1,000 risking 1% per trade (0.01 lots), when your account grows to $10,000, the system automatically scales to 0.10 lots while maintaining 1% risk. This compounds your growth while protecting during losses."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will this help me pass prop firm challenges like FTMO?",
      "answer": "Yes! Prop firms have strict rules: maximum daily loss (5%), maximum total loss (10%), minimum trading days, consistency requirements. Our risk management system enforces these rules automatically - stopping trading when daily loss limit is hit, ensuring compliance with all prop firm requirements. Many Accra Central traders use our systems specifically for prop firm challenges."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the risk manager work across multiple EAs on my account?",
      "answer": "Yes! We can build portfolio-level risk managers that monitor ALL EAs running on your account and enforce global limits. For example, if you run 3 different EAs, the risk manager ensures the TOTAL daily loss across all three never exceeds your limit (e.g., 5%), even if individually they're performing differently."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the emergency kill switch feature?",
      "answer": "The kill switch is a fail-safe that instantly closes all open positions and stops all EA trading with a single action - either pressing a button on chart, specific market conditions, or remote command. Essential for high-volatility events like major news releases or unexpected market crashes."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does risk management integration cost in Accra?",
      "answer": "Standalone risk manager module: $300-600. Full integration into existing EA with advanced features: $600-1200. The price depends on complexity, number of EAs to protect, and specific requirements. Given that a single account blowup can cost thousands of dollars, this is essential protection for serious Accra Central traders."
