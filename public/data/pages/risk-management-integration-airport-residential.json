  "faq": [
    {"question": "How does professional risk management protect me while traveling?", "answer": "The system operates 24/7 automatically. Automated loss limits, position sizing, and emergency controls protect your accounts whether you're in Accra, traveling internationally, or unable to monitor markets. The EA follows your risk rules without requiring your presence."},
    {"question": "Can you manage risk across accounts at different brokers?", "answer": "Yes! We build portfolio-level risk managers monitoring accounts across multiple MT4/MT5 brokers simultaneously. Global limits apply to your entire trading operation—total exposure, aggregate daily loss, maximum concurrent risk—all managed centrally regardless of broker."},
    {"question": "What position sizing algorithms do you offer?", "answer": "We implement various algorithms: Kelly Criterion (mathematically optimal sizing), Fixed Fractional (consistent percentage risk), Optimal F (maximum growth rate), Volatility-Based (ATR-adjusted), or custom algorithms tailored to your strategy. We recommend the best approach based on your trading style."},
    {"question": "How quickly can you integrate risk management into my existing EA?", "answer": "Typical integration takes 1-2 weeks including consultation, development, testing, and delivery. Rush service available for urgent needs (48-72 hours) at premium rates. We prioritize quality and thorough testing over speed."},
    {"question": "Do you provide ongoing risk management consultation?", "answer": "Yes. Many Airport Residential clients engage us for ongoing advisory—quarterly reviews, parameter optimization, new account integration, performance analysis. We offer retainer arrangements for comprehensive ongoing support matching professional standards."},
    {"question": "What makes your service worth $600-1200 for professionals?", "answer": "Institutional-quality code, bespoke risk architecture, professional testing, comprehensive documentation, premium support, and proven track record protecting millions in trading capital. A single account blowup costs far more—this is insurance for your trading business."},
    {"question": "Can you handle large accounts ($50k-$500k+)?", "answer": "Absolutely. Our systems scale from small accounts to substantial capital. Many Airport Residential clients manage $100k-$500k+ across multiple prop firm accounts. Advanced position sizing, correlation controls, and portfolio-level management are designed for serious traders with substantial capital."}
