  "faq": [
    {"question": "What makes institutional risk management different from standard EA controls?", "answer": "Institutional systems include advanced position sizing algorithms (Kelly Criterion, Optimal F), portfolio-level correlation analysis, multi-tier loss limits, volatility regime detection, stress testing against historical crises, professional monitoring dashboards, and comprehensive audit trails. This is how hedge funds and prop trading firms protect capital—far beyond basic stop losses and fixed lots."},
    {"question": "Can you manage risk across my entire trading portfolio in Cantonments?", "answer": "Absolutely. We build portfolio-level risk managers that monitor ALL your trading accounts—personal accounts, multiple prop firm challenges, different brokers—and enforce global limits. Total exposure, correlation between pairs, aggregate daily loss, maximum concurrent risk—all managed centrally across your entire operation."},
    {"question": "How does the system handle accounts growing from $10k to $500k+?", "answer": "Dynamic position sizing automatically scales as your equity grows. Using Kelly Criterion or Optimal F algorithms, the system calculates mathematically optimal position size based on current equity, strategy win rate, and average win/loss ratio. As your account compounds from $10,000 to $500,000, position sizing scales proportionally while maintaining consistent risk percentage."},
    {"question": "What level of customization is available for Cantonments traders?", "answer": "Completely bespoke. We design risk frameworks specific to your requirements: custom position sizing algorithms, unique loss limit structures, tailored correlation controls, specific volatility thresholds, integration with your existing reporting systems, custom dashboards and analytics. This is white-glove service—your risk management reflects your exact needs."},
    {"question": "How do you ensure confidentiality for high-net-worth traders?", "answer": "Professional discretion is paramount. We sign NDAs, maintain strict confidentiality about your strategies and capital, use secure communication channels, and never share client information. Many of our Cantonments clients are diplomats, executives, and high-profile individuals—discretion is standard."},
    {"question": "What's included in the premium $1200-2500 portfolio-level package?", "answer": "Comprehensive service including: executive consultation and bespoke framework design, advanced MQL development with institutional coding standards, portfolio-level risk management across all accounts, custom position sizing algorithm implementation, multi-tier loss limit system, correlation and exposure controls, professional testing and validation, comprehensive documentation and training, 60 days premium support, dedicated support channel, and complete source code ownership."},
    {"question": "Do you provide ongoing risk management consultation?", "answer": "Yes. Many Cantonments clients engage us for ongoing risk advisory beyond initial development—quarterly strategy reviews, risk parameter optimization as markets evolve, new account integration, performance analysis, and continuous improvement. We offer retainer arrangements for comprehensive ongoing support."}
