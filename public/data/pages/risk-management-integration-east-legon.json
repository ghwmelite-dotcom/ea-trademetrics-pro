  "faq": [
    {"question": "How does modern risk management differ from basic EA controls in East Legon?", "answer": "Basic EAs use fixed lots and simple stop losses. Our modern systems employ dynamic position sizing algorithms, portfolio-level loss limits, correlation analysis, volatility-adjusted sizing, drawdown protection, and emergency controls. This is the difference between retail tools and professional trading infrastructure."},
    {"question": "Can you integrate risk management into EAs from other developers?", "answer": "Yes! We integrate our risk frameworks into any EA with source code (.mq4/.mq5). The integration preserves your trading logic while adding institutional-grade risk controls. Perfect for East Legon traders using purchased or custom EAs."},
    {"question": "How does dynamic position sizing help me scale my East Legon trading?", "answer": "Position sizing automatically adjusts based on account equity. Start with $2,000 risking 2% = 0.04 lots. Grow to $20,000 = automatically scales to 0.40 lots maintaining 2% risk. This compounds growth during wins while protecting during losses by reducing size during drawdowns."},
    {"question": "Will this help me pass prop firm challenges while trading from East Legon?", "answer": "Absolutely! Prop firms have strict rules: 5% daily loss, 10% total loss, consistency requirements. Our system enforces these automatically—stopping trading when limits are reached, tracking metrics, ensuring compliance. Many East Legon traders use our systems specifically for prop challenges."},
    {"question": "Can I manage risk across multiple prop firm accounts?", "answer": "Yes! We build portfolio-level managers monitoring all your accounts—multiple FTMO, MyForexFunds, personal accounts—and enforce global risk limits. Perfect for East Legon traders scaling across multiple funded accounts."},
    {"question": "What happens during high-volatility events like NFP or Fed announcements?", "answer": "Volatility-adjusted sizing monitors ATR and automatically reduces position size when volatility exceeds normal levels. During major news, the system protects you by trading smaller lots or pausing completely based on your settings. Essential protection for algorithmic traders."},
    {"question": "How much does professional risk management cost for East Legon traders?", "answer": "Comprehensive EA integration: $600-1200. Advanced portfolio systems: $1000-1800. Price depends on complexity and features. Given that one account blowup can cost thousands, this is essential insurance for serious traders building sustainable trading businesses in East Legon."}
