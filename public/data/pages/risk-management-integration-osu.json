  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How does professional risk management differ from basic stop loss in Osu?",
      "answer": "Basic risk management in typical EAs only uses fixed lot sizes and stop losses. Our advanced systems include dynamic position sizing that adapts to account size, portfolio-level loss limits across all trades, correlation analysis to prevent overexposure, volatility-based sizing adjustments, trailing drawdown protection, and emergency controls. This is institutional-grade protection vs. basic retail tools."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use this for multiple trading accounts in my Osu office?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We can build portfolio-level risk managers that work across multiple MT4/MT5 accounts simultaneously. Perfect for traders managing personal accounts plus multiple prop firm challenges, or running different strategies across various brokers. Global risk limits apply across your entire trading operation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will this help me pass prop firm challenges in Accra?",
      "answer": "Yes! Prop firms like FTMO, MyForexFunds, and The5ers have strict rules: max 5% daily loss, 10% total loss, consistency requirements. Our system automatically enforces these limits—stopping trading when daily loss is hit, tracking consistency metrics, and ensuring full compliance. Many Osu traders specifically use our risk systems for prop challenges."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does dynamic position sizing work for account growth?",
      "answer": "The system calculates position size based on current account equity and your risk percentage. Start with $1,000 risking 2% = 0.02 lots. Grow to $10,000 = automatically scales to 0.20 lots while maintaining 2% risk. This compounds your profits during winning streaks while protecting capital during drawdowns by reducing position size."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens during high-volatility events like NFP?",
      "answer": "Volatility-adjusted sizing monitors ATR (Average True Range) and automatically reduces position size when volatility spikes above normal levels. During NFP, Fed announcements, or unexpected news, the system protects you by trading smaller lots or pausing trading completely based on your configured settings."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you integrate this into EA I bought from MQL5 marketplace?",
      "answer": "If you have the source code (.mq4/.mq5), yes! We can integrate our risk management framework into any EA. However, protected/encrypted EAs from marketplace without source code cannot be modified. In that case, we build a standalone risk manager that monitors and controls the EA externally."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's included in the $600-1200 full integration package for Osu traders?",
      "answer": "Full integration includes: consultation and risk framework design, complete MQL coding and EA integration, dynamic position sizing (your choice of algorithm), daily/weekly/monthly loss limits, correlation controls, volatility adjustments, emergency kill switch, comprehensive testing, full documentation, 30 days support, and source code ownership. One-time investment for lifetime capital protection."
