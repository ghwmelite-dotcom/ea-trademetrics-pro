  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between local and remote copy trading?",
      "answer": "Local copying works on the same PC/VPS for instant trade replication, perfect for traders in Accra Central managing multiple accounts on one server. Remote copying uses MT4/MT5 signals service or custom servers to copy trades across different locations with slight delay, ideal for serving subscribers globally from your Accra Central base."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can subscribers have different risk settings in Accra Central?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Each subscriber can have individual lot multipliers, maximum risk per trade, symbols to include/exclude, trading hours settings, and maximum daily loss limits. This allows Accra Central signal providers to serve diverse client bases with different risk appetites."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I charge subscribers for signals in Ghana?",
      "answer": "We integrate payment systems like Stripe, PayPal, or Flutterwave (popular in Ghana) for automated subscription billing. We can also implement license key verification systems or connect to the MQL5 signals marketplace, depending on your business model in Accra Central."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I filter which trades get copied to subscribers?",
      "answer": "Yes! You can implement quality filters such as: only copy trades with specific profit targets, exclude trades during news events, filter by win rate percentage, minimum trade duration, or specific trading sessions. This ensures Accra Central subscribers receive only high-quality signals."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many subscribers can one master account support in Accra Central?",
      "answer": "Hundreds or thousands depending on implementation. Local copying on a VPS in Accra Central is limited by server resources, while remote/server-based systems scale to unlimited subscribers globally. We help you choose the right architecture for your growth plans."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you provide training on running a signal service business?",
      "answer": "Yes! Along with the technical system, we provide business consulting on pricing strategies, subscriber acquisition, performance marketing, and customer retention specifically for Accra Central and the broader African trading market."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the system work with multiple master accounts?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! You can run multiple strategies from different master accounts, allowing Accra Central signal providers to offer tiered subscription plans (conservative, moderate, aggressive) or specialized strategies for different market conditions."
