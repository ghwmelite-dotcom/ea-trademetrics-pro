  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How many years of historical data do you test in Accra?",
      "answer": "We typically backtest using 5-10 years of historical data to ensure your EA works across different market conditions, economic cycles, and volatility regimes. This comprehensive testing is crucial for strategies targeting Ghana and international markets from Accra Central."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between backtesting and optimization?",
      "answer": "Backtesting evaluates your EA's performance with fixed parameters on historical data. Optimization systematically tests thousands of parameter combinations to find the best settings for maximum profitability. We combine both for comprehensive validation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you prevent over-optimization in your Accra service?",
      "answer": "We use walk-forward analysis, out-of-sample testing periods, and Monte Carlo simulations to ensure optimized parameters work on unseen data, not just the optimization period. This prevents curve-fitting and ensures real-world reliability."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you backtest strategies that aren't coded yet?",
      "answer": "Yes! If you have clear trading rules documented, we can code a basic EA specifically for backtesting purposes, then provide comprehensive results and recommendations before committing to full EA development."
    },
    {
      "question": "What quality of data do you use for backtesting?",
      "answer": "We use high-quality tick data from reputable institutional providers. For MT5 testing, we use real tick data with every-tick precision. For MT4, we use the highest quality M1 data available with precise bar modeling for accurate results."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does the backtesting process take for Accra clients?",
      "answer": "Standard backtesting takes 1-2 weeks depending on complexity. Simple single-symbol tests may complete in 3-5 business days, while comprehensive multi-symbol optimization with walk-forward analysis takes the full 2 weeks. Accra Central clients receive priority scheduling."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you serve traders outside of Accra Central?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! While based in Accra Central's financial district, we serve traders throughout Greater Accra Region including Osu, East Legon, Tema, and all surrounding areas. Remote collaboration available for clients across Ghana."
