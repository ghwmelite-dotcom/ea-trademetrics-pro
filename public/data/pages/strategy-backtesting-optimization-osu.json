  "faq": [
    {"question": "How many years of historical data do you test?", "answer": "We typically backtest using 5-10 years of historical data to ensure your EA works across different market conditions, economic cycles, and volatility regimes. This comprehensive testing is crucial for strategies targeting Ghana and international markets."},
    {"question": "What's the difference between backtesting and optimization?", "answer": "Backtesting evaluates your EA's performance with fixed parameters on historical data. Optimization systematically tests thousands of parameter combinations to find the best settings for maximum profitability."},
    {"question": "How do you prevent over-optimization?", "answer": "We use walk-forward analysis, out-of-sample testing periods, and Monte Carlo simulations to ensure optimized parameters work on unseen data, not just the optimization period."},
    {"question": "Can you backtest strategies that aren't coded yet?", "answer": "Yes! If you have clear trading rules documented, we can code a basic EA specifically for backtesting purposes, then provide comprehensive results and recommendations."},
    {"question": "What quality of data do you use?", "answer": "We use high-quality tick data from reputable institutional providers. For MT5, we use real tick data with every-tick precision. For MT4, we use the highest quality M1 data."},
    {"question": "How long does backtesting take?", "answer": "Standard backtesting takes 1-2 weeks. Simple single-symbol tests may complete in 3-5 business days, while comprehensive multi-symbol optimization takes the full 2 weeks."},
    {"question": "Do you serve traders in other Accra districts?", "answer": "Yes! While conveniently located near Osu, we serve traders throughout Greater Accra Region. Remote collaboration available for clients across Ghana."}
