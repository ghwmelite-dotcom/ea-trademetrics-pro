  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Why do I need EA maintenance if my bot is working fine in Accra Central?",
      "answer": "Even well-functioning EAs require ongoing maintenance. MetaTrader platforms update regularly (often breaking old code), brokers change specifications, and market conditions shift. Proactive maintenance prevents future issues and keeps your EA optimized for current market conditions in Accra and globally."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's included in the Bronze, Silver, and Gold maintenance plans?",
      "answer": "Bronze ($99/mo): 1-2 EAs, 48hr response, basic updates. Silver ($199/mo): 3-5 EAs, 24hr response, monthly performance reviews, optimization recommendations. Gold ($399/mo): unlimited EAs, 12hr response, white-glove service, priority development, dedicated account manager."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly do you respond to EA issues in Accra Central?",
      "answer": "Response times depend on your plan: Bronze 48 hours, Silver 24 hours, Gold 12 hours. Critical issues affecting live trading receive expedited response across all tiers. We understand Accra Central traders need reliable support for their automated systems."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you maintain EAs built by other developers?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We maintain EAs from any source as long as we have access to the source code (.mq4/.mq5 files). If you only have compiled files (.ex4/.ex5), we can still maintain them but may incur additional decompilation fees."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you provide support for brokers used by Accra Central traders?",
      "answer": "Yes! We have experience with 50+ international brokers commonly used by Ghanaian traders. We can adapt your EA for broker-specific requirements and ensure compatibility with your chosen trading platform."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if my EA stops working suddenly?",
      "answer": "Contact us immediately via your priority support channel. We'll diagnose the issue, provide a fix within your plan's guaranteed timeframe, and implement preventive measures to avoid recurrence. Critical downtime situations receive expedited response."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I upgrade or downgrade my maintenance plan?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can change plans anytime. Upgrades take effect immediately; downgrades take effect at your next billing cycle. All plans are month-to-month with no long-term contracts required."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is EA maintenance necessary for prop firm trading?",
      "answer": "Highly recommended! Prop firms have strict rules and performance requirements. Our maintenance ensures your EA stays compliant with prop firm rules, adapts to any rule changes, and maintains consistent performance required for funded accounts."
