  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Why should Osu traders invest in EA maintenance?",
      "answer": "Osu's fast-paced business environment demands reliable trading systems. EA maintenance prevents costly downtime, keeps your bots updated with platform changes, optimizes performance for current markets, and provides expert support when issues arise - protecting your automated trading income."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between maintenance plans?",
      "answer": "Bronze ($99/mo) covers 1-2 EAs with 48hr response. Silver ($199/mo) covers 3-5 EAs with 24hr response plus monthly performance reviews. Gold ($399/mo) provides unlimited EA support, 12hr response, and white-glove service with dedicated account manager."
    },
    {
      "question": "How fast do you respond to issues in Osu?",
      "answer": "Response times: Bronze 48 hours, Silver 24 hours, Gold 12 hours. Critical live trading issues get expedited attention across all plans. We understand Osu traders need fast, reliable support for their businesses."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you maintain EAs from other developers?",
      "answer": "Yes! We maintain any EA if we have source code access (.mq4/.mq5). For compiled-only files (.ex4/.ex5), maintenance is possible but may require decompilation fees. We've worked with EAs from dozens of developers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you support international brokers used in Osu?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. We have experience with 50+ international brokers popular with Ghanaian traders. We adapt EAs for broker-specific requirements and ensure compatibility with your chosen platform."

      "question": "What if my EA breaks during live trading?",
      "answer": "Contact us immediately through your priority support channel. We'll diagnose the issue quickly and provide a fix within your plan's guaranteed timeframe. Critical issues affecting live trades receive our fastest response."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I change my maintenance plan later?",
      "answer": "Yes! Upgrade anytime (takes effect immediately) or downgrade at next billing cycle. All plans are month-to-month with no long-term contracts - perfect flexibility for Osu's dynamic business environment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is maintenance important for prop firm EAs?",
      "answer": "Essential! Prop firms have strict rules. Our maintenance ensures EA compliance, adapts to rule changes, maintains required performance consistency, and helps you keep your funded accounts. Many Osu prop traders rely on our service."
